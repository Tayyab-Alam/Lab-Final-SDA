Service-Oriented Architecture

The Energy Management System (EMS) is designed to efficiently manage and analyze energy consumption data through a series of interconnected components. The system consists of four primary elements: a mobile application, a cloud server, a smart meter, and an analytics module. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the system.

Components of the System
Mobile Application:
The mobile app serves as the user interface, allowing users to access and visualize their energy consumption data.
It provides features such as displaying real-time energy usage, historical data trends, and insights derived from analytics.

Cloud Server:
The cloud server acts as a centralized repository for storing and processing energy data collected from smart meters.
It facilitates communication between the smart meter and the mobile app, ensuring that data is transmitted securely and efficiently.

Smart Meter:
The smart meter is responsible for collecting detailed energy usage information from residential or commercial properties.
It sends this data to the cloud server for further processing, enabling real-time monitoring of energy consumption.

Analytics Module:
The analytics component analyzes the energy data stored in the cloud server to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
It generates reports and insights that help users understand their energy usage better and make informed decisions about energy conservation.

Workflow of the System
Data Collection:
The smart meter continuously collects energy consumption data and periodically sends this information to the cloud server.

Data Transmission:
Upon receiving the data from the smart meter, the cloud server processes it and prepares it for access by the mobile application.

User Access:
Users can access their energy consumption data through the mobile app, which retrieves information from the cloud server.

Data Analysis:
The analytics module analyzes the collected data to provide meaningful insights into energy usage patterns.
This analysis can include identifying peak usage times, suggesting ways to reduce consumption, and forecasting future energy needs.

Insights Delivery:
The results of the analysis are made available to users through the mobile app, enhancing their understanding of their energy habits and encouraging more efficient usage.

output
After the smart meter sends energy data to the cloud server and the analytics module processes this data, the system will generate an analysis result. This output typically includes:
Summary of Energy Usage: A brief overview of total energy consumption over a specified period.
Comparison Metrics: Information comparing current usage against historical data or benchmarks.
